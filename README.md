# a2hs
Add to Home screen (or A2HS for short) is a feature available in modern browsers that allows a user to "install" a web app, ie. add a shortcut to their Home screen representing their favorite web app (or site) so they can subsequently access it with a single tap. This guide explains how A2HS is used, and what you need to do as a developer to allow your users to take advantage of it.
